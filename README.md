### :vampire:' I am a vampire enthusiast. :vampire: [^1]
*It all started when my friend in church talked about her favorite book series Twilight.* :church: Before this conversation, I already had an interest in fairytale adapatations due to growing up with media such as Ever After High, Monster High, Descendants, The Grimm Sisters, Shrek (:fairy:==fairy godmother is so iconic==:fairy:), and every golden age to silver age Disney animated movie. The jump into Twilight was not super crazy for someone like me. However the teenage awkward romance made it such a hilarious journey (hilarious for both book and movie, but easier to laugh at the books and harder to endure through the movie).
![I'm so sorry Taylor Lautner for laughing so hard at this!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-was-a-real-scene-of-actress-Kristen-Stewart&psig=AOvVaw1QQ3zvD__egFob-k3DrvMe&ust=1690189509179000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCLiMwN68pIADFQAAAAAdAAAAABBf)

I highly enjoy the idea of being in a never aging body living in a palatial, grandiose gothic castle in the country sides. Being able to live forever to learn about the world and not worrying about running out of time. I'd love to just go to school forever if not for real life happening.

### 🎨 Painting and drawing is my passion 🎨
It's always been an interest of mine since when I first could hold a crayon. I enjoy drawing characters and painting portraits. Maybe one day I can get to the levels of the renaissance painters?

### 📖 One thing in my bucketlist is to publish a graphic novel 📖
Under my belt already are deleted webcomics that I created in the fourth and fifth grade. Hopefully I can make something I can be proud of to publish and not delete one day.

### 🎮 Another thing in my bucketlist is to publish a cute video game :video_game:
I don't know what the video game would be about to be completely honest. But it'd be cool to make a simple cute game.

### :notes: I am a musician! :notes:
More specifically a pianist, clarinetist and bass clarinetist!

### :cinema: On the topic of music, I'm also a thespian! (I think?) :cinema:
I love musicals, and decided to audition one day since I had nothing to lose. I ended up getting into the cast of Beauty and the Beast at my high school! And now I'm hoping to do more musical productions in my free time!

### 🎞️ Oh and I love to animate! :film_strip:
I love Gobelins and CalArts! I love Coraline, Mr. Fantastic Fox, Red Line and all kinds of animation. I hope to attend CSSSA or Gobelins summer program or even get to attend their schools one day (add Sheridan into the mix too!). All my sketchbook goals are in comparison to the Calarts Sketchbooks.

### 🗼 I am a francophile! 🗼
I had aspired to get into Gobelins, so I decided to take French in school. Now I'm hooked and hope to get fluent in a couple of years just because I like the language and different cultures francophone countries have!
